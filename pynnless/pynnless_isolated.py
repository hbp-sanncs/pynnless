"""
Provides a wrapper around PyNNLess which isolates running the network into its
own process, thus allowing to use PyNNLess multiple times and ensuring a "fresh"
state each time. Furthermore it serializes access to the hardware systems,
allowing multiple processes using the specified backend to be started
concurrently.

Note however, that the provided PyNNLessIsolated class comes with a performance
overhead due to inter process communication and that not all public methods of
the PyNNLess class are implemented to the full extent.
